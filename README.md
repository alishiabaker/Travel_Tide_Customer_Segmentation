# Travel_Tide_Customer_Segmentation
The E-booking startup TravelTide, has entered the online travel industry. As a new player in this industry, the CEO is very motivated to retain and add value to existing customers with a Marketing strategy built on understanding of customer behavior. 
The new head of marketing (Elena Tarrant), was brought on to supercharge the marketing efforts at Travel Tide, with a mission to design and execute a fantastic personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. 
As a member of the data analytics team, I was responsible for supporting Elena's rewards program project. In order to grab the customers attention and maximize likelihood they will sign up for the rewards program, we focused on emphasizing the perk we felt each customer would most likely be interested in upon asking them to sign up via personalized emails. 
I was prompted to pull the data based on specific timeline and assign users to perks based on their behaviorial metrics. This is known as customer segmentation. I constructed a SQL query to pull all the neccessary data needed to properly analyze the user's behaviors. Raw data was transferred to Google Sheets for further analyzation and then segmented into groups based on the perk I felt would appeal to each customer most. After successful segmentation, I designed a presentation to share my recommendations with the marketing team.
